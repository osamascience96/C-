# We have 3 basic Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort(Done)
2. Merge Sort
3. Bubble Sort

# TODO
1. Understand each Sorting Algorithm.
2. Understand their time complexity.
3. In each of your Program, read each of these files.
4. Apply the Sorting Algorithm.
5. Store the sorted data in the Sorted Files with the particular name
6. Make another file that contains their resultant runtime of a particular file against the algorithm applied to that file.
