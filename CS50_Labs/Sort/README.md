# We have 3 basic Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort(Done)
2. Bubble Sort(Done)

# TODO
1. Understand each Sorting Algorithm.
2. Understand their time complexity.
3. In each of your Program, read each of these files.
4. Apply the Sorting Algorithm.
5. Store the sorted data in the Sorted Files with the particular name
6. Make another file that contains their resultant runtime of a particular file against the algorithm applied to that file.


# NOTES:
  Analyze the data from the file in Algorithm.txt that the Selection Sort Runtime is better than the Bubble Sort
