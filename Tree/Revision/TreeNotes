Note:- Each Subtree are disjoints from each other subtree.

Degree of Node: Any Node that contains n number of nodes as its desendants. This could be the degree of any Node i-e Root or SubNode(that could also be Subtree)

Degree of Tree: A degree of the tree is that node in the tree that has the highest degree.

Leaf/Terminal Node: The Node with the degree 0.

Level: Each Node is assigned a level number. Each descendant node has the (l+1) level from its ancestors nodes, where l is the level of the node(ancestor).

Generation: Nodes that belongs to the same level belongs to the same generation.

Height/Depth: The longest branch in the tree OR The branch with most number reached levels in the tree is the Height/Depth of the tree.

Edge: Line drawn between any 2 nodes in the tree OR any line connecting two nodes in the tree is the edge.
      Note: The direction of the edge any tree is from top to bottom only.

Path: Sequence of consecutive edges.

Branch: Path ending on a leaf node.

Note: Branch can contain many paths, a branch can also be refered to as a path.

Binary Tree:- A tree that has its 2 desendants in every node it it is the binary tree.
Binary Tree can be represented in both arrays and linkedlist using the pointer structure.
	Node Structure:

	Left Ptr    Right Ptr
