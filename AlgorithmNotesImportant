Important formulas to understand....

Space Complexity s(p) = c + s(instance characteristics)
Time Complexity of Loop(N) = Number of Primitive Operations * N | N is the number of iterations of the loop

Important Steps to be in sequence to be performed to measure the time complexity of an algorithm........
If we increase the level of space complexity to the instance, where our proposed algorithm can work, then we can easily overcome with the space complexity.
About the time complexity, scientists are researching to overcome with this time domain of the algorithm, but for the trivial solution in this situation, by changing the algorithm to achieve our target, we can somehow overcome with the time domain problems.


1)Measure Input Size
2)Type of Operations
3)Type of Complexity of the Algorithm
4)We define the Asymptotics of an algorithm based on the input size and selected complexity.
5)We define the Complexity Class of that function we made in step 4 to measure the final complexity of an algorithm...

As the size of the input increases, the running time also increases.

when calculating the equation, all the co-officients and constants are ignored in the final results.

Note: It is tricky to calculate the average case of an algorithm, so we define the function bounds that describes the relation between differnt running time of the algorithms as per the size of the input increases
