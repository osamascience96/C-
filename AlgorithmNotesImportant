Important formulas to understand....

Space Complexity s(p) = c + s(instance characteristics)
Time Complexity of Loop(N) = Number of Primitive Operations * N | N is the number of iterations of the loop

Important Steps to be in sequence to be performed to measure the time complexity of an algorithm........

1)Measure Input Size
2)Type of Operations
3)Type of Complexity of the Algorithm
4)We define the Asymptotics of an algorithm based on the input size and selected complexity.
5)We define the Complexity Class of that function we made in step 4 to measure the final complexity of an algorithm...
